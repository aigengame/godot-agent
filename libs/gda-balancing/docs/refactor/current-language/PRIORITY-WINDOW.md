# Early priority-window witness (#878)

Base: shared dev `1596e77ea6807d4b91b8709da52c72eed346b0de`, after #877.
[#878](https://github.com/aigengame/godot-agent/issues/878) owns acceptance; the
[plan](PLAN.md) owns sequencing. This record starts with a falsified candidate and
open implementation work. Functional evidence remains candidate/open; #575 retains
the complete scenario family and #542–#544 retain their activation conditions.

## Contract and first checks

The existing bADR-0014/0016/0017 boundaries remain binding: `game.action` owns pending
actions and their outcomes; `game.turn` owns response order, priority, pass/close policy
and bounded nesting. Runtime owns the existing input/transition/observation phases.
The witness must execute reusable Operations, compute its state from inputs, and
expose the resulting stack, priority and stable pending identities at each boundary.

Two responders, a proposal, a counter, a counter-to-counter and consecutive passes
form the initial candidate. Resolution must inspect the actual pending graph in
reverse order. A counter proposal does not immediately erase its target; cancellation
occurs prospectively during resolution after the window closes. A valid pass-choice
variant must change the final result under the same rules. An invalid responder or
counter target must have a declared refusal. These are proposed scenario boundaries,
not implemented observations.

The first checks target two independent risks: whether the current value/Operation
basis can represent that protocol without fabricated state, and whether complete
renaming exposes host-selected meanings. No Record construction, extra phase or
callback is assumed to exist. A concrete missing capability reopens the basis before
dependent content expands; it must not be hidden by a prescribed trace or a genre
branch.

## Falsified Formula owner selection

The [first counterexample](evidence/priority-window/notation-owner-counterexample.json)
renames the exact namespace `standard.schema` to `probe.schema`. Both authority
graphs admit; Kernel bytes and its fixed constructor/profile/reason tokens are
unchanged. The same Source bytes pass public `model check` and `model build` on the
baseline, producing all eight Model members. The renamed graph refuses both commands
with `language.source_contract_mismatch` at the two Formula bodies.

The host's Formula notation resolver filters by the literal package name before
looking for the unique admitted `model-source-package` wire-schema owner. That
restriction contradicts the already admitted graph. Remove it and derive the owner
through the existing closure role and artifact kind, retaining uniqueness checks.
This is a prerequisite repair to generic authority consumption, not a new genre
dispatch rule. Its permanent public regression must distinguish the original defect.

The original dev candidate therefore fails this bounded renaming check. After repair,
freeze both implementations before deriving the full witness graph, inventory and
bijection. The same fixed builds must then process original, extended, renamed and
input-variant cases. Do not describe the original build as invariant, or count this
single namespace substitution as complete inventory validation.

## Remaining proof and integration

- Derive every reachable non-Kernel token and occurrence from the applicable Kernel/LDB,
  node, constructor and authored-input contracts. An ordinary JSON string walk cannot
  distinguish an identity from user data. A graph rooted at the complete LDB includes
  all of its referenced packages and vector sets; selected RIR closure alone does not
  replace that graph.
- Independently validate complete coverage and an exhaustive bijection. Missing classes
  or members, duplicate/extra mappings and renamed reserved Kernel identities refuse.
  Keep exact renamed artifact identities distinct; inverse-map observations only for
  the declared equivalence comparison.
- Reuse independent authority admission, lowering and Event execution. Four independently
  lowered artifact kinds and a helper that executes one Operation do not by themselves
  prove complete multi-boundary result exchange. Close that consumer path explicitly.
- Run the real baseline and input variants, plus bounds, illegal callback and phase cases.
  Then run required CI and separate Standards/Spec/DDMA reviews before merging into dev.

Rollback restores the complete base code, authority, authored inputs and evidence in
an isolated checkout and repeats a public build/run. No fallback, parallel owner or
formal Extension Invariance Receipt is introduced to make this functional tracer pass.
