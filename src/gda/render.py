"""Human-readable rendering for ``gda`` results — the presentation layer.

The result models (``gda.models``) are pure ``--schema`` / ``--json`` data
contracts (ADR-0004); presentation does not live in them. This module owns the
human-readable text path: one renderer per result type, plus the typed helpers
that keep the presentation layer from reaching into a model's value shape or
across a union of result types. A command binds its renderer on its own
``HeadlessCommand`` descriptor (``render=``, ADR-0023) — there is no central
type-keyed dispatch table here; emission calls the descriptor's renderer.

Since ADR-0040 a group's own renderers live in its ``gda.commands.<group>``
module, beside the descriptors that bind them; what stays here are the helpers
shared ACROSS groups. Two such seams are deliberately funnelled through one
place here:

- **Value-to-text.** A node property's ``value`` is arbitrary JSON (every Godot
  type carried uniformly, :class:`~gda.models.NodeProperty`). :func:`format_value`
  owns the JSON projection so no renderer reaches into ``.value`` with a raw
  ``json.dumps``.
- **Node-tree outline.** :func:`render_node_tree` walks any node shape carrying
  ``name``/``type``/``children``, so the on-disk ``scene``/``node`` trees and the
  runtime ``game`` tree share one indented outline.

    past Python's recursion limit, so this walks the tree with an explicit stack

    produce) rather than recursing per level and raising an unstructured
    ``RecursionError`` on a deep-but-valid tree.
